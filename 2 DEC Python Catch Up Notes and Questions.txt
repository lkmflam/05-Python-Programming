In positional formatting
	{:>10} <-- Pads 10 spaces to the left. What does the colon do? Does that mean to pad?
	{:d} <-- I know that the letter means to signal what type the data is, but more 	explanation on {:10.5} etc.
	Truncating and padding explained

print('My favorite car is a {car} and motorcycle {motorcycle}'.format(**things)) <-- What do the stars mean?

%s and %r, these are replaced by !s and !r, but are they just placeholders for ('test1', 'test2')? (Answered below)

Format Symbol	Conversion
%c	character
%s	string conversion via str() prior to formatting
%i	signed decimal integer
%d	signed decimal integer
%u	unsigned decimal integer
%o	octal integer
%x	hexadecimal integer (lowercase letters)
%e	exponent notation
%f	floating point real number


what does it mean to append in python?
Append: Adds its argument as a single element to the end of a list. The length of the list increases by one. ... If you append another list onto a list, the first list will be a single object at the end of the list.

Lab 3B decrypting with XORs -- Do not understand at all, so will come back to

Lab 3C started and easier due to if, elif, else statements
	input = raw_input("> ") <-- Instructions example, what do the parentheses mean?
	Once an option is chosen, do I have to put exit? How do I pull out of the loop?
Lab 3D After completion, get user input to accept numbers and add them to a list that will go on 	until the user doesn't want to continue
	Want to use the index values
Asks user for int --> stores int in an index --> when user continues --> pulls from those location

For Loops using dictionaries

x = {'stu1':'James', 'stu2':'Bob', 'stu3':'Rengar'}

for stu_id, name in x.items():
    print("{}'s name is {}".format(stu_id, name))

Iterative vs. Recursive Loops
	Recursion is basically a function that executes multiple times by calling itself within 	its own function... CALLS ITSELF TO EXECUTE AGAIN

Appending to a List Example - list.append(variable)

shopList = [] 
maxLengthList = 6
while len(shopList) < maxLengthList:
    item = input("Enter your Item to the List: ")
    shopList.append(item)
    print shopList
print "That's your Shopping List"
print shopList

The class List section is helpful "listing" all the things that can be done.
Map, Filter, and Reduce is beneficial. This section would be great for practicing.

Dictionaries (Lab to practice is to 2H and is the grade calc from Code Academy)
	Set and Frozenset - Need to go over/ explained
	A set is an unordered collection of elements, immutable, but can't be used as a 	dictionary key or an element of another set. Frozensets are the same but immutable. 	Meaning that once created, cannot be added to, etc.

Conversion Functions- Look at them and have explained in what cases you would need to use them.

Python Pickle Library- serializing and deserializing
“Pickling” is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, and “unpickling” is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream (from a binary file or bytes-like object) is converted back into an object hierarchy.
