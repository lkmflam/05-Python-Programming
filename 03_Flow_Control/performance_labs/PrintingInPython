Please complete the following questions. Mess around with formatting as much as possible, use the 3 methods of formatting that we learned. Old % formatting, str.format(), and formatted string literals        ( print (f’ ‘) ). Refer to your notes or the python docs to get examples on how to do each.

 1. Write a program that displays the following information:
	• Your name
	• Your address, with city, state, and ZIP
	• Your telephone number
	• Your MOS
main()
	name = input(“Please enter your name:”)
	streetaddress = input(“Please enter your street address:”)
	city = input(“Please enter your city:”)
	state = input(“please enter your two-letter state abbreviation:”)
	zipcode = input(“Please enter your 5-digit zipcode:”)
	telephone = input(“Please enter your phone number in strictly number format:”)
	mos = input(“Please enter your MOS”)

	state = state.upper()
	print(“Name: {}”.format(name))
	print(“Address: {} {} {} {}”.format(streetaddress, city, state, zipcode”))
	print(“Telephone: ‘{:d}’”.format(telephone))
	print(“MOS: {}”.format(mos))
end()	


2.  A company has determined that its annual profit is typically 23 percent of total sales. Write
a program that asks the user to enter the projected amount of total sales, and then displays
the profit that will be made from that amount.

main()
percent = 0.23
projectedsales = input(“Please enter the projected amount of total sales.”)
profit = projectedsales * percent
print ‘%f’ % (profit)


3.  One acre of land is equivalent to 43,560 square feet. Write a program that asks the user to
enter the total square feet in a tract of land and calculates the number of acres in the tract.

main()
feetperacre = 43560
totalsquarefeet = input("Please enter the total square feet in the tract of land.")
acre = totalsquarefeet / feetperacre
acreageinfo = {'feet': feetperacre, 'total': totalsquarefeet, 'total acres': acre}
print("There are {feet} feet in an acre. You input that your tract is {total} square feet large.
With this information, your tract is {total acres} acres large.".format(**acreageinfo))
end()

 4. A customer in a store is purchasing five items. Write a program that asks for the price of
each item, and then displays the subtotal of the sale, the amount of sales tax, and the total.
Assume the sales tax is 6 percent.

main()
//Want to eventually make a loop that asks for user input on items and then adds each item into a list
//or go to the dictionary and then will input the values entered by the user (key and value).
//Then once displayed, the price will be shown for the item
	item1 = input(Enter the price for the first item:")
	item2 = input(Enter the price for the second item:")
	item3 = input(Enter the price for the third item:")
	item4 = input(Enter the price for the fourth item:")
	item5 = input(Enter the price for the fifth item:")
	sum = item1 + item2 + item3 + item4 + item5
	salestax = .07
	total = (salestax * sum) + sum

	//Does the price or key value attached to the item number have to be a new variable?
	//items = {'item1': 'price', 'item2': 'price', 'item3': 'price', 'item4': 'price', 'item5': 'price'}
	// Could do a dictionary and then for each item within the dictionary (key), then add the key for the sum function.
	
	math = {'subtotal': sum, 'tax': salestax, 'total': total}
	print("The the subtotal of the items purchased is {sum} with the tax amount being {salestax}.
	This leaves the total to be {total}.".format(**math))

5.  Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels down the interstate can be calculated with the following formula:
Distance = Speed * Time

 A car is traveling at 60 miles per hour. Write a program that displays the following:
	• The distance the car will travel in 5 hours
	• The distance the car will travel in 8 hours
	• The distance the car will travel in 12 hours
//Could create a dictionary of the values with the number of hours being the keys OR
//Create a list with the distance values inside and reference the index number within the function

main()
speed = 60
distance1 = speed * 5
distance2 = speed * 8
distance3 = speed * 12
// distancelist = [distance1, distance2, distance3]

print("In 5 hours, the car would travel {} miles.\n In 8 hours, the car would travel {} miles.\n 
In 12 hours, the car would travel {} miles.".format(distance1, distance2, distance3))
End()

6.  Write a program that will ask the user to enter the amount of a purchase. The program
should then compute the state and county sales tax. Assume the state sales tax is 4 percent
and the county sales tax is 2 percent. The program should display the amount of the purchase, the state sales tax, the county sales tax, the total sales tax, and the total of the sale
(which is the sum of the amount of purchase plus the total sales tax).

main()
purchaseamount = input("Please enter the amount of your purchase.")
statetax = .04
countytax = .02
total = (statetax * purchaseamount) + (countytax * purchaseamount) + purchaseamount

7.  A car’s miles-per-gallon (MPG) can be calculated with the following formula:
 MPG = Miles driven / Gallons of gas used
Write a program that asks the user for the number of miles driven and the gallons of gas
used. It should calculate the car’s MPG and display the result.

// Would theoretically like to make this into a loop and ask the user if they are done
// inputting values or if they would like to move on. All of the values that they input 
// would then get added to a list or even do the keys and values of a dictionary.
//HINT: May be wise to pull up my old class documentation

main()
milesdriven = input("Please enter the number of miles that you've driven.")
gallonsused = input("Please enter the number of gallons that you have used.")
mpg = milesdriven / gallonsused

8.  Write a program that calculates the total amount of a meal purchased at a restaurant. The
program should ask the user to enter the charge for the food, and then calculate the amount
of a 15 percent tip and 7 percent sales tax. Display each of these amounts and the total.

9. Write a program that converts Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit temperatures. The formula is as follows:

 F = (9/5)C + 32

 The program should ask the user to enter a temperature in Celsius, and then display the
temperature converted to Fahrenheit.


10.  Last month Joe purchased some stock in Acme Software, Inc. Here are the details of the
purchase:
• The number of shares that Joe purchased was 1,000.
• When Joe purchased the stock, he paid $32.87 per share.
• Joe paid his stockbroker a commission that amounted to 2 percent of the amount he paid
for the stock.
Two weeks later Joe sold the stock. Here are the details of the sale:
• The number of shares that Joe sold was 1,000.
• He sold the stock for $33.92 per share.
• He paid his stockbroker another commission that amounted to 2 percent of the amount
he received for the stock.

 Write a program that displays the following information:
• The amount of money Joe paid for the stock.
• The amount of commission Joe paid his broker when he bought the stock.
• The amount that Joe sold the stock for.
• The amount of commission Joe paid his broker when he sold the stock.
• Display the amount of money that Joe had left when he sold the stock and paid his
broker (both times). If this amount is positive, then Joe made a profit. If the amount is
negative, then Joe lost money
